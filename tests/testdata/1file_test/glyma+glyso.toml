Glycine (soybean or soya bean) is a genus in the legume family Fabaceae.
The cultivated soybean, Glycine max, is native to East Asia and
is an especially important food crop there because it is cheap
and nutritious.  The ease with which they are grown is partly
reasons reflected in the genomes: the flowers are hermaphroditic,
containing both stamen and pistil, making them self-pollinating.

Glycine soja is the closest wild relative of soybean, Glycine max.
Populations of G. soja exist in the wild in China, Japan, Korea, and Russia.
Analysis of genetic differences between the two species suggests that the two
separated approximately 200 thousand years ago. The species remain interfertile,
and G. soja accessions are used in breeding projects in order to introgress
traits such as tolerance to particular diseases or environmental stresses."""
